it's not reasonable to expect std::sort to work on std::list.

std::sort requires random access iterators, which allow constant-time access to any element (like v[i]). This is because sorting algorithms like quicksort and heapsort need to jump around in the container efficiently.

std::list provides only bidirectional iterators, which can move forward and backward one step at a time, but can't perform random access.

Trying to implement random access on a linked list would be extremely inefficient, requiring O(n) traversal for each access.

The standard library's design intentionally guides users toward efficient solutions for their specific data structures. Trying to make std::sort work on a list would be defeating the fundamental data structure characteristics.

If someone wants to sort a std::list, they can use std::list::sort(), or convert to a random access container. 


Update after Initial submission and Implementation of sort.cpp:

While it's possible to make std::sort work with std::list as demonstrated by my implementation, 
it's still not entirely reasonable to expect the standard library's std::sort to work on std::list.

Sorting a linked list using a generic algorithm requires O(n) extra space for merging for forward iterators.
For bidirectional iterators, we can use in-place merging but it's still less efficient than specialized container methods.
Finding the middle element is O(n) for linked lists vs. O(1) for random access containers


The C++ standard library is designed around performance contracts and interface segregation. 
Algorithms specify their minimum iterator requirements to communicate performance characteristics
This allows users to understand the efficiency implications of their code and encourages using the right data structure for the task at hand.
